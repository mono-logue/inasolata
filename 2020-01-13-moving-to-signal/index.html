    <h2>Moving to Signal</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>I've decided to move ~exclusively to <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a> after the latest WhatsApp privacy policy changes.</p><p>Have I read it? No, I actually have not even received the warning as my phone's memory is full and I'm running and older version of WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2><p>I have been troubled with WhatsApp since day one. I always avoided it and used Skype and Viber instead. I already had Skype for years when it was still cool, then joined Viber before it was the bloat it is today. Viber had so much more features compared to WhatsApp and it was not Facebook, of course.</p><p>But one day I installed WhatsApp without much thought for reasons that had nothing to do with me really needing WhatsApp. I threw my privacy concerns in the bin in exchange of socialising with some certain people, before realising that pretty much everyone was using it actually. I've used the end to end encryption as an excuse to myself, even though I new the F company was behind it and that meant that one way or another they were harvesting as much as they could from my metadata.</p><h2 id="back-to-the-future">Back to the future</h2><p>I am aware that this policy update may not really impact my privacy much more that it already does. The update, for me, has been more of a reminder to amend my mistake. A reminder to go back to my old self, be more strict with myself, my friends, my family, the people that matter to me, about our collective perception of privacy and what we do to maintain it. In the meantime I've met people and I've connected with them through WhatsApp. Not because of WhatsApp but though it as a common, popular medium. Vendor lock in is here to stay, at least we could do better at choosing our vendor, until a day where we will replace custom services with universal protocols that anyone will access through the service they prefer. RSS, I miss you &lt;3</p><h2 id="why-signal">Why Signal?</h2><blockquote><p>Because Elon said so</p></blockquote><p>Well, not really, actually I chose Signal because of</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://signalfoundation.org/">Signal Foundation</a></li><li>The Open Source Signal App</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike">Moxie Marlinspike</a></li></ul><h3 id="the-signal-foundation">The Signal Foundation</h3><p>The Signal Foundation is a nonprofit and at the time of writing the only business model they claim to have for making Signal sustainable is donations. Ideally <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/i-am-the-david-going-against-the-goliath-that-i-created-brian-acton-of-signal/65663/1">they claim</a> that they would like to see themselves succeeding just like Wikipedia did. Of course the sustainability of Wikipedia seems questionable near the end of every year when the red banners of horror come out but I have not done much research on this topic.</p><p>In any case, I personally plan to support the donations model and wait and see how this will work out for the future of the service. The foundation has initially received a big injection of $50 million in the form of a 0% interest loan by its executive chairman and WhatsApp co founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Acton">Brian acton</a>.</p><h3 id="why-is-the-foundation-important">Why is the Foundation important?</h3><p>Well, because as a nonprofit Signal has no obvious reason to make any profit other than what it needs to be sustainable and able to continue to provide its services to its users. That means that there is no need for them to bombard you with advertisement or sell your data, as long as each user, or at least the majority understand that nothing is really free on the internet and are willing to donate towards the cause of having an open, privacy respecting service for us all to communicate.</p>
